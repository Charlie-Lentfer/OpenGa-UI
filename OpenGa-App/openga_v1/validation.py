openga_v1.validation
====================

Checks that can actually fail.

Three groups:

``internal``   arithmetic and closure. If one of these fails the model is
               broken, not merely uncertain.
``regression`` reproduction of the source workbook and of the earlier WP3/WP4
               figures. A failure here means the port has drifted.
``divergence`` documented disagreements with the published inventory. These
               are NOT failures. They are the places where this model and Luo
               et al. part company, reported so the difference is visible
               rather than buried.

None of this validates an input. It confirms the arithmetic is internally
consistent and reproduces its source. It cannot tell you whether the feed
assay, the caustic dose, the completeness factor or any emission factor is
right, and most of them are placeholders.
